## REGEX URL Gist

Regex is similar to searching or matching code to the characters. Usually, there would be more characters used to match one character at a time. Characters used would not represent one character but also other characters that will match the string of characters.

## Summary

The chosen regex that I will be covering is matching a URL which is: `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`. The code contains a variety of characters which includes symbols such as `/`, `^`, \, `*`, `.`, `?`, `$`, `[]`, `{}`, and `+`. Throughout the whole gist, each characters will be explained in details.
